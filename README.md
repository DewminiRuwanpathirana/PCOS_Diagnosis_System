Research Project: Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for PCOS Diagnosis with Explainable AI

This research project proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates ultrasound scan images and clinical data to improve the accuracy of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis. The model also incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance transparency and provide visual and textual explanations for predictions, supporting clinical decision-making.
